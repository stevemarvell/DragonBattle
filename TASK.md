# Task

Create a command line PHP application that simulates a battle between two dragons.

## Rules

The script should optionally ask for the names of the dragons.

The script should optionally ask for the total bouts to be fought. Default to 1 The script should randomly create 2
dragons, and simulate a turn based fight between them. The script should be verbose, describing everything that happens
during the battle. The script should end when one of the dragons is defeated.

You are free to implement this in any way you choose, however please inform us of any assumptions or decisions you have
made, and why, and remember this is an enterprise engineering task with all the expectations of that level. Show us what
youâ€™re good at.

## Interpretation and Implementation

This is an "anything" combat system, not a dragon combat system. Dragon in context, is a combatant. A combatant is
therefore an interface.

Health is largely self-contained, and so can be made a trait. It is intrinsically linked to combat, so needs to have an
interface. Setting health less than zero is a mistake, not an exception, so set to zero. This alleviates any need
for `takeDamage` to concern itself with the actual effect. Rather is just obeys the rules. Setting largely seem an
internal process and the `setHealth()` method should be `private`.

There is no point in having `Dragon extends Creature` and `Creature extends Object` so that objects can have names,
because that's a future assumption. We can always promote names that later. Nor is there merit in letting something
be `Nameable`.

Luck could be used for anything and so should be separated. Testing will require luck to have a dependency injection 
for dealing with randomness.

Attack and defence are attributes of combat only. They might be a data clump. 

There is a real, but not assumed possibility that the match will be less boring with multiple actions. The rules of
interaction of these actions, together with other attributes may necessitate a game type object. Given the requirement 
for a narrator, the dependency injection gets quite deep and would necessitate extra code to avoid message chains.
Better to have an umpire who can manage the rules, the player, the time, and the narrator.

The dragon going first at random is on the backlog.

A static factory seemed appropriate to handle the dependency injection and defaults.

Command line arguments:

`php dragon-battle.php [--name1=NAME] [--name2=NAME] [--bouts=NUMBER]`

Defaults:

    name1="Dragon 1"
    name2="Dragon 2"
    bouts=1

Turns are sequential, with one attack following another, not simultaneous attacks. Therefore, in each turn, there will
be one attacker and one defender amd so damage in one direction. This way, there can be no draws.

    damage = attack - defence

    luck can dodge and double defence
    luck can pierce and double attack

Combat has no options, so does not deserve a Strategy pattern.

## Remaining Questions

What to do with unnamed dragons?
